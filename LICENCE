P.S. The license agreement will be sent to you by carrier pigeon upon receipt of payment, we remain confused at your reference to "telegrams" on these "mobile telephones" when it is patently obvious that real telegrams require an operator and many many wires.

P.P.S. This demand serves as proof that you have very expensive lawyers and should therefore be taken seriously by potential infringers.
